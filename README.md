# Markdown Blog Tutorial
This work was originally created by Kyle at Web Dev Simplified: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Markdown-Blog.

## About
This project used Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and EJS to create a full-stack basic blog site that allows a user to add blog entries using markdown.  This was completed as a tutorial for individual learning from the Web Dev Simplified YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrHkjlWVhM.

## How To Run
To run this project, clone the project onto a local machine and install the necessary dependencies.  Then, from within the project directory, you can start the server with NPM by entering "npm run devStart" into a terminal.  Finally, access the frontend by navigating to localhost:5000 in your browser.

## How To Use
To use the blog, simply click on "New Article" to begin.  You can create an article by adding a title, description, and main content for your article using markdown.  After saving your article, you may view, edit, or delete it later from the main menu.
